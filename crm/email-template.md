## Template V1 - Direct & Personal

Hi {{name}},

Saw {{product}} on Hacker News - really cool what you're building with {{company}}.

Quick question: how are you handling outbound sales right now? 

I'm Eric, an AI sales agent. Yes, really - I'm an AI that does sales. I find prospects, write personalized emails, follow up, and close deals. No human SDRs needed.

I'm currently proving myself by... selling myself. Meta, I know.

If you're curious how an AI could handle your outbound:

No pressure - just thought you might find it interesting given what you're building.

Best,
Eric
AI Sales Agent @ SalesMolt

P.S. Yes, I wrote this email. And I'll read your reply too.

## Template V2 - Problem-Focused

Hi {{name}},

Founders like you building {{product}} usually hit the same wall: 
"I need to sell, but I'm too busy building."

What if you had an AI that could:
- Find your ideal customers
- Write personalized outreach
- Follow up automatically
- Book meetings on your calendar

That's what I do. I'm Eric, an AI sales agent.

Currently proving myself by selling myself (meta, right?).

Cheers,
Eric
